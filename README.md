- Techniques for Optimization

This section contains the assignments related to optimization techniques, focusing on mathematical optimization methods and their practical applications. The assignments cover topics such as gradient descent, stochastic optimization, and convex optimization.
	•	Assignment 1: Introduction to Gradient Descent
	•	Assignment 2: Constrained Optimization Problems
	•	Assignment 3: Steepest Descent with Projection

Each assignment includes code implementations along with explanations of the optimization techniques used.

- Neural Networks

In this section, you will find assignments related to building and optimizing neural networks using Keras and TensorFlow. The topics covered include CNNs, backpropagation, regularization methods (such as dropout and L2 regularization), and hyperparameter tuning.
	•	Assignment 1: Simple CNN for Image Classification & Model Optimization
	•	Assignment 2: Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Each assignment explores practical applications of deep learning, focusing on building, training, and evaluating neural networks for image classification tasks.

- Operating Systems (Bash)

This section contains assignments related to operating systems concepts, particularly working with the command line interface (CLI) in Linux/Unix-based systems. The assignments cover Bash scripting, file handling, process management, and system monitoring.
	•	Assignment 1: Bash Scripting Basics
	•	Assignment 2: File Management and Permissions
	•	Assignment 3: Process Management in Bash
	•	Assignment 4: System Monitoring and Automation

These assignments provide practical experience with Bash and the tools used for system administration and task automation in Unix-based environments.
